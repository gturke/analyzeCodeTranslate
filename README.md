# Field Experiment Analysis Program for Python
**Authors:** <a href=mailto:gturkeaflcio.org>Grace Turke</a>  
**Last Code Update:** 20160803

**Current Version:** v1.0

Builds on ideas from [Chris Kennedy's](https://github.com/ck37) rcteval\_ado [Stata module](https://github.com/ck37/rcteval_ado) for evaluating randomized controlled trials


### NOTE: This is still a work in progress and is not ready for use

## Project Description  
Base syntax for analyzing randomized controlled trials in Python using logistic regression. Intended for tests with individual-level units of analysis.

---
## To-Do's
1. Fix known issue with analysis function when there are only two conditions, but they were not coded as 0/1 by the user. Automate process.
2. Add syntax that will write output to files that can be used to quickly and easily create visualization.
3. Add syntax (or create separate .py file/project) for data wrangling.
4. Conduct paralell analyses in python and stata and compare results - they should be equal.
5. Update README with instructions for use by others
