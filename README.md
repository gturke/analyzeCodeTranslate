**Authors:** <a href=mailto:gturkeaflcio.org>Grace Turke</a>  
**Last Code Update:** 20160803
**Current Version:** v1.0

## Project Description  
Base syntax in python for analyzing field experiments using logistic regression. Intended for tests with individual-level units of analysis, like persuasion or GOTV experiments.

---
## To-Do's
1. Fix known issue with analysis function when there are only two conditions, but they were not coded as 0/1 by the user. Automate process.
2. Add syntax that will write output to files that can be used to quickly and easily create visualization.
3. Add syntax (or create separate .py file/project) for data wrangling.
4. Conduct paralell analyses in python and stata and compare results - they should be equal.
5. Pilot with real project, not just fake data.

## Instructions
1. This will vary depending on the code
2. If SQL Query, then;
  * If using CTE's or subqueries, then describe each discrete portion of query.
  * Also, explain joins.
3. If Python, R, Stata, Bash, then;
  * Describe each function. This should largely match the comments or documentation strings in your code.
  * If you aren't using functions, then;
    * consider using functions.
    * or, make sure to break code into discrete parts, and describe them here.
4. Reference Data Science Workflow below to inform code flow and instructions.

## Tests
1. Either a description of a unit testing script, or
2. A list of some tests that should be run to validate code.
